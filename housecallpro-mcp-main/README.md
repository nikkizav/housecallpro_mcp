**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

Or download ZIP and extract to chosen directory.

### 3. Get Housecall Pro API Key

1. Log into your Housecall Pro account
2. Go to App Store > API Key Management > Generate
3. Generate your API key
4. Copy your API key (keep it secure!)

### 4. Environment Setup

Change ".env.example" to ".env"
Fill in API Key with no space after =


### 5. Configure Claude Desktop

#### Copy the claude_desktop.json template and paste into your AI MCP server config.


#### Update paths in `claude_desktop_config.json`:

> **Note**: The API key will be automatically read from your `.env` file - no need to include it in the JSON configuration.

> **Important**: If `uv` is not in your system PATH, replace `"uv"` with the full path to the uv executable (e.g., `"C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\.cargo\\bin\\uv.exe"` on Windows).

**Windows:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "housecall-pro-customers": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\\\Users\\\\YourUsername\\\\path\\\\to\\\\HousecallPro-mcp",
        "run",
        "housecallpro_customers.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
## Etc. Add all servers from the template provided and change the path to where you cloned.


**macOS/Linux:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "housecall-pro-customers": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/Users/yourusername/path/to/HousecallPro-mcp",
        "run",
        "housecallpro_customers.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
## Etc. Add all servers from the template provided and change the path to where you cloned.

### 6. Restart Claude Desktop

After configuring, restart Claude Desktop to load the new MCP server. You should now see the MCP servers available in the search and tools tab.

## 📝 Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask Claude things like:

- "Show me all customers"
- "Get me the customer ID for "name" "
- "Create a new customer named John Doe"
- "List all addresses for customer 12345"
- "Add a new address for customer 12345"

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Server not found"**
   - Check that the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is correct
   - Ensure `uv` is installed and accessible
   - If `uv` command not found, either:
     - Add `uv` to your system PATH, or
     - Use the full path to `uv` in the configuration (e.g., `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\.cargo\\bin\\uv.exe` on Windows)

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Verify your API key in the `.env` file
   - Check that your Housecall Pro API key has the necessary permissions

3. **"Permission denied"**
   - Make sure the Python file is executable
   - Check that uv has proper permissions
